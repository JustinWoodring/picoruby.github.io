## List of Opportunities for Contribution

### Porting

As of 2023, PicoRuby supports only the RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico).
It would be a significant undertaking to port it to other MCUs like the nRF52, STM32, and ESP32.

If you are interested in contributing to a porting, please visit the repository: [https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby](https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby)

### Documentation

This documentation site is still a work in progress.
Organizing information and enriching the usage examples for each API, could be more helpful to a wider range of users.

If you are interested in contributing to the documentation, please visit the repository: [https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby.github.io](https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby.github.io)

### Sponsoring

By becoming a GitHub sponsor of PicoRuby, you can support us financially.
The sponsorship funds will be used for purchases such as microcontrollers, peripheral devices, testing equipment, and more, assisting us in various ways: [https://github.com/sponsors/picoruby](https://github.com/sponsors/picoruby)

### Using PicoRuby and writing about it

Above all, create your projects using PicoRuby and share them through your Twitter or blog.
This step will significantly contribute to expanding the world of Ruby on Microcontroller, marking a big leap forward.
