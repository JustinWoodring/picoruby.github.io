This section describes how to set up R2P2 and provides general information for R2P2 newbies.

## **IMPORTANT**: Laptop Security Settings

If your laptop is configured to prohibit writing to USB memory devices, likely due to your company's security policy, it will not functionðŸ˜£

### Mac Issues

- From our experience, Mac laptops occasionally encounter issues during the workshop
- We are unsure of the specific models that may have problems. Both Intel Macs and M1/M2/M3 Macs have had issues in the past
- Please be aware that we will not be able to know if your Mac will work until the day of the workshop

## Install R2P2 into Raspi Pico

- Download the latest *R2P2-PICORUBY-\*.uf2* from GitHub https://github.com/picoruby/R2P2/releases (Of course, unzip it)

- Connect Pi Pico and PC while\\npressing the BOOTSEL button. Then you'll find *RPI-RP2* (for Raspi Pico) or *RP2350* (for Pico2) drive in file manager (File Explorer or Finder)

- Drag & drop *R2P2-\*.uf2* into RPI-RP2 drive

- You'll find "R2P2" drive (sometimes naming the drive fails and it shows "USB Drive" or something like that. But it would be working anyway)

- Open a proper serial port on the terminal emulator. Information about terminal emulators can be found in [/terminal-emulator](/terminal-emulator)

- If you could see a screen like this, congrats, now you are at the gateðŸŽ‰

  - R2P2 shell is a Unix-like shell, so you can use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `rm`, etc.
  - `irb` command starts an interactive Ruby shell

Congratulations! Now you at the gate!

Before starting to dig into R2P2, we would like you to **stargaze** at the [picoruby/picoruby](https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby) repoðŸŒŸ
